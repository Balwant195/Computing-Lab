Due to the bug in the function, it concatenates the argument strings in both ways and concatenate them further to return the result. For example, CONCAT(\"A\", \"B\") will return the string ABBA. Given a list of strings to concatenate with each other (in any arbitrary order) employing the CONCAT(char *, char *) function, what is the maximum length of the final string that might get generated.\n",
